# ACCRUED claim blocks - These are claim blocks that a player earns over time, typically for free, as they play on the server.
#  *Players accumulate accrued claim blocks at a rate set by the server admin (e.g., 100 blocks/hour of playtime).
#  *These blocks are not bought or given as a bonus—they are earned naturally through gameplay.
#  *They have a cap (maximum accrued claim blocks) to prevent players from accumulating infinite blocks.
# BONUS claim blocks - These are additional claim blocks that an admin can give to a player manually or through commands.
#  *Bonus blocks are often given as rewards, purchased through in-game economies, or granted for promotions or events.
#  *They are added on top of accrued claim blocks and do not expire unless explicitly removed.
# TOTAL claim blocks - The sum of a player’s accrued claim blocks and bonus claim blocks.
#  *This is the total number of claim blocks a player can use to claim or expand land.
#  *Total claim blocks = Accrued claim blocks + Bonus claim blocks
# REMAINING claim blocks - The number of claim blocks available for new claims (not currently used in existing claims).
#  *This is calculated as: Total claim blocks - Blocks used in existing claims
#  *This prevents players from sending blocks that are already being used, avoiding negative balances.
#  *Remaining claim blocks = Total claim blocks - Used claim blocks
